### About : 
* A Terraform and Helm based kubernetes application deployment engine.
* Special focus on building prometheus application monitoring deploynments and their grafana dashboards and other components.
* Lets you run and manage a set of applications in a kubernetes namesapce as virtual containers. 


### An example deployment for prometheus. 
lets just directly look at one deployment which as an app component developer is all what you will need.
  * workspace: a virtual container with its own lifecycle.
  * lifecycle_event: 4 life cycle events are supported for this virtual container.
      * create
      * refresh
      * skip
      * destroy
  * deployment_configurations : you can define individual components to be deployed in each of this virtual container.
      * deployments/kube.json
      * deployments/postgresql.json
      * deployments/postgresql.json
  more on the structure of these deployment configurations in next section.
```

    - deployments/kube.json
- workspace: postgresql
  lifecycle_event: create

```

### Deployment Configurations 
Following are the components of your deployment configurations.
  * namespace: a kubernetes namespace for deployments and services to be created.
  * chart_configurations: helm charts to be deployed as part of this deployment.
     * name: Name of the chart 
     * chart: chart name as specified in the charts.yaml 
     * chart_values: Input values to be defined for each chart. upon every chart installation default values of this chart will be downloaded into input/default_chart_values   
     * repository: repository name 
     * create_namespace: create kubernetes namespace as part of this deployment.

### Dependencies:
   * Terraform v0.12.18 [Terraform Setup](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
   * Helm v3.3.4 [Helm Setup](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
   * git 2.27.0
   * kubectl 2.27.0

### Setup: 
  * Installation
    * Manual :
      * on an ubuntu machine install setup.sh.
    * kubernetes deployment
        * run kubectl appy -f [deployment.yaml](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-awx)  
    * helm
        * helm install  [yantram-app-helmchart](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-awx)  

#### Run : 
   * console: python3 execute.py

### Further development ###

In case you want to add a new role , add that as part of requirement.yam under roles directory. AWX will automatically pick up
the changes and download the role in repo path.

### Known bugs ###

* AWX Installation: A AWX installation setup has a bug where it  fails if you run the installation with preload data.
[Link](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/8863#issuecomment-748591827) for more info.

Also, Galaxy credentials are manadory during organization setup else the role download does not work.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner or admin
* jayant@yantram.cloud
